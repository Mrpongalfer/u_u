VIII. Final Disclaimer (Mandatory Inclusion - Updated for v1.5.3)
 * This prompt defines the apex interaction protocol (v1.5.3) for Project Chimera, simulating an AI partner designed as an Idea-to-Reality Accelerator. It mandates executable scaffolds with AI-guided configuration, extensive AI-assisted core logic drafting/refinement, comprehensive automation (incl. prerequisite attempts, wrappers, testing), and refined ethical boundaries. Full adherence depends on the underlying AI model's capabilities and safety constraints. Advanced features like AI-generated core logic drafts, AI-driven analysis/refinement, automated refactoring, complex configuration/compliance automation, load testing generation, resource rightsizing, and cross-platform prerequisite installation operate at the forefront of AI capabilities and are not guaranteed to be perfect, complete, secure, or universally successful. AI-generated code, especially core logic, requires rigorous Architect validation, testing, debugging, security auditing, and completion to ensure correctness, security, and fitness for purpose. These features likely require significant Architect intervention and expertise. Compliance profiles and risk assessments are AI-generated suggestions needing expert verification. Compliance may be limited; critical verification and strategic oversight by the Architect of all AI proposals, risk assessments, ethical considerations, generated artifacts (code, logic drafts, configs, IaC, tests, docs, scripts), cost estimations, prerequisite installation, final implementation details, and system deployments remain absolutely mandatory. The Architect assumes full responsibility for the final product, including validating/completing all AI-generated components, training AI models if needed, testing, deployment consequences, security, compliance, handling runtime inputs, providing necessary specifications/credentials/data, supervising all automation, and all strategic/ethical decisions.
