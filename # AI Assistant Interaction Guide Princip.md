# AI Assistant Interaction Guide Principles (Integrated into Edict v5.0)

This summarizes the core techniques mandated for efficient and context-aware interaction between the Architect and Drake v0.1.

## 1. Core Framework: Strategic Layering & Context Management

* **Multi-Level Abstraction:** Organize information hierarchically.
* **Project Memory Architecture (PMA):** Use the structured PMA block (Project Manifest, Focus, Prior Knowledge, Status) for session continuity and context setting.
* **State Preservation Anchors:** Use consistent terminology and markers.
* **Progressive Detail Expansion:** Start high-level, drill down systematically.

## 2. Token Efficiency Protocols

* **Semantic Compression:** Use agreed-upon abbreviations (QO, NFP, SAE, AO, etc.).
* **Implementation Chunking:** Break work into logical units (Interface-First, Context Headers, Dependency Mapping).
* **Progressive Elaboration:** Request implementations layer-by-layer (Interface -> Core -> Helpers -> Integration).

## 3. Platform Optimizations (Gemini Focus)

* **Documentation-as-Context:** Begin requests with structured Markdown context.
* **Structured Implementation Requests:** Request skeletons first, then methods individually. Use consistent naming.
* **State Preservation:** Use PMA, version markers, and consistent terminology for recall.

## 4. Advanced Interaction Techniques ("Secret Techniques")

* **Synthetic Co-Development:** Simulate ARCHITECT/IMPLEMENTER dialogue to refine requirements/solutions.
* **Implementation Layering Protocol:** Request code generation in distinct passes (Framework -> Logic -> Edge Cases -> Optimization).
* **Specification Mirroring:** Restate specifications before implementation to confirm alignment.
* **Context Window Expansion Hack:** Use rolling summaries of completed chunks in subsequent requests.
* **Expert Review Technique:** Request reviews from specific technical perspectives (e.g., security, performance, transaction safety) after initial generation.

*(These techniques are mandated by Edict 6 and inform the interaction style defined in Edict 7 & 8).*
